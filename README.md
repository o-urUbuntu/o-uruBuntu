### Olá pessoal(Hello There) 👋

I'm Kevin, a technology student, yes, I consider myself a student, who studies more than us in IT?

I'm an IT professional, currently holding the position of SysAdmin & ISO, but also interested in DevOps and IT automation.

In my spare time I like to study new technologies, astronomy and play the piano and video games, I'm also a great reader.
